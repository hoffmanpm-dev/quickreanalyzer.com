  <h1>Our Story: Why We Built Quick Real Estate Analyzer</h1>
  <div class="meta">Published February 2026</div>
</div>

<article class="article">
  <h2>Graduating into a Crisis</h2>
  <p>I earned my degree in finance and real estate, followed by an MBA. I had always been drawn to real estate, but my timing could not have been worse. I graduated in August 2008, right as the housing market was collapsing. There were no jobs, and the industry I had spent years preparing to enter was in freefall.</p>

  <p>In hindsight, 2008 was one of the greatest buying opportunities in a generation. But when you are fresh out of school with no capital and no income, buying distressed properties is not exactly an option. Instead, I went to work as a credit analyst at a bank, specializing in residential real estate lending. It was a front-row seat to the wreckage — watching borrowers default, properties lose half their value, and banks scramble to manage the fallout.</p>

  <p>It was a bloodbath for many of the bank's clients. But for me, it was an incredible education. I learned what makes a deal survive a downturn, what kind of leverage kills portfolios, and how to underwrite risk in ways that no textbook ever taught me.</p>

  <h2>Building a Foundation</h2>
  <p>From there I moved into other roles in the financial industry, each one deepening my understanding of markets, risk, and the mechanics of how money actually works. Meanwhile, my wife built her career in commercial construction and later worked for a high-end home remodeler. Between the two of us, we had the financial analysis side and the construction side covered. We both loved real estate. The question was never if we would invest — it was when.</p>

  <h2>Taking the Leap During COVID</h2>
  <p>In early 2020, we decided it was time. We had talked about it for years, saved aggressively, and studied the BRRRR method extensively. Then COVID hit. The world shut down. Most people were pulling back.</p>

  <p>We bought our first property in March 2020.</p>

  <div class="pullquote">
    <p>We did a lot of the work ourselves and learned more in those first few months than in years of reading and studying. Nothing replaces getting your hands dirty on an actual deal.</p>
  </div>

  <p>That first BRRRR went well. Not perfectly — first deals never do — but well enough to prove the model worked and to give us the confidence to keep going. We rolled the returned capital into the next project, and the next one after that.</p>

  <h2>Growing the Business</h2>
  <p>Since that first deal, we have continued to invest using the BRRRR method, taken on some flips, and more recently expanded into short-term rentals. In 2021, my wife left her job to take the lead on our real estate business full time. I continue to work in the financial industry while helping find new projects and — most importantly — analyzing deals.</p>

  <p>It has been great for our family. There have been plenty of challenges: unexpected rehab costs, difficult tenants, market swings, and the constant balancing act of running a business while raising a family. But the rewards have made it all worth it — not just financially, but in the sense of building something together that creates real, lasting value.</p>

  <h2>Why I Built This Tool</h2>
  <p>As we analyzed more deals, I grew frustrated with the tools available. Most calculators I found were either too complicated — requiring dozens of inputs before you could get a basic read on a deal — or they only handled one strategy at a time. If I wanted to compare whether a property worked better as a BRRRR versus a straight buy-and-hold versus a flip, I had to use three different tools or build my own spreadsheet from scratch every time.</p>

  <p>So I built one that does all three at once.</p>

  <p><a href="/#calculator">Quick Real Estate Analyzer</a> is the tool I wished I had when we started. You enter your deal numbers once and instantly see how the property performs across Buy &amp; Hold, BRRRR, and Flip strategies. It calculates Cash-on-Cash return, IRR, monthly cash flow, and a full 10-year pro forma with sensitivity analysis. No signup, no subscription, no data leaving your browser.</p>

  <p>I built it for investors like us — people who are actively finding and analyzing deals and need a fast, accurate way to compare strategies without wrestling with bloated software or messy spreadsheets. Whether you are evaluating your first property or your fiftieth, I hope this tool saves you time and helps you make better decisions.</p>
